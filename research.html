      <div style="font-size: 13pt">Complex, dependable and physically-entangled systems of systems must be supported by innovations to allow a significant reduction of the cost and complexity of system design targeting computing platforms composed of parallel heterogeneous architectures. Software development is one key challenge, as current programming tools do not fully support emerging processor architectures. Parallel and heterogeneous platforms are difficult to program and even more to optimise for the multiple conflicting criteria imposed by applications, such as performance, energy efficiency, real-time response, resiliency and fault tolerance. AMPERE addresses this challenge by incorporating model-driven engineering (MDE) as the key element for the construction of complex software architectures. MDE enables to efficiently capture system's functional and non-functional requirements, including multiple conflicting requirements, as well as enabling the use of domain specific model-driven languages (DSML) to further refine the description of cyber/physical interactions. The vision of AMPERE is that there is a clear necessity of developing a new generation of code synthesis methods and tools capable to implement correct-by-construction systems, in which the constraints captured by the system model are efficiently transformed to the parallel programming models supported by the underlying parallel heterogeneous platform, whilst providing the level of performance required. Moreover, AMPERE will provide computing software composed of a set of advanced run-time methods implementing monitoring and dynamic reconfiguration techniques, that will support the parallel execution to improve the overall system's efficiency, and guarantee that the non-functional requirements capture by the DSML are fulfilled. AMPERE advances will be integrated in a set of ready-touse tools and libraries, and validated through demonstration in two reference applications, from automotive and railway domains. <a class="link_name" href="https://ampere-euproject.eu/" target="_blank">More</a></div>

      <div style="font-size: 13pt">Big data is nowadays being integrated in systems requiring to process a vast amount of information from (geographically) distributed data sources, while fulfilling the non-functional properties (real-time, energy-efficiency, communication quality and security) inherited from the domain in which analytics are applied. Examples include smart cities or smart manufacturing domains. ELASTIC will develop a novel software architecture (SA) to help system designers to address this challenge. The SA will incorporate a novel elasticity concept to distribute and orchestrate the resources across the compute continuum (from edge to cloud) in an innovative fog computing environment. The new elasticity concept will enable to match analytics workload demands and fulfilling non-functional properties. The fog computing architecture will incorporate energy-efficient parallel architectures, combined with innovative distributed storage, secure communications and advanced cloud solutions. Overall, the SA will enable the combination of reactive data-in-motion and latent data-at-rest analytics into a single extreme-scale analytics solution, in which the analytics workloads will be efficiently distributed across the compute continuum based on their suitability and data processing needs. The capabilities of ELASTIC will be demonstrated on a real smart-mobility use case, featuring a heavy sensor infrastructure to collect data across the Florence tramway network, equipped with advanced embedded architectures, heterogeneous sensors, V2I connectivity and access to cloud resources. Representative applications for advanced driving assistant systems, predictive maintenance and public/private transport interaction, have been selected to efficiently process very large heterogeneous data streams from distributed sensors. ELASTIC technology will enable the development of innovative mobility services while preparing the technological background for the advent of full autonomous mobility systems. <a class="link_name" href="https://elastic-project.eu/" target="_blank">More</a></div>

      <div style="font-size: 13pt">ClimateRobo is an autonomous intelligent mobile robot for climate purposes, which notifies the weather condition based on environmental data. An ATmega32 microcontroller is used to measure temperature, gas, light intensity, and distance to obstacles using the LM35DZ, MQ-2, photocell, and infrared (IR) sensors. A utility function is proposed to calculate the weather condition according to the temperature and gas data. Afterwards, the weather condition will be monitored on a liquid crystal display (LCD), an appropriate light-emitting diode (LED) will be illuminated, and an audio alarm would be enabled when weather condition is emergency as well as ambient brightness is high. The ambient brightness is calculated by a proposed supervised machine learning using sensed data of the photocell sensor. A fuzzy decision system is proposed to adjust the speed of DC motors based on weather condition and light intensity. The robot can detect and pass stationary obstacles with the six reflective sensors installed in the left, front, and right sides under six detection scenarios. The robot, initially, is simulated in the Proteus simulator and, then, is implemented by electronic circuits and mechanical devices. It would be used in the future by bureau organizations, rescue teams, etc.</div>

      <div style="font-size: 13pt">The fan system uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy theory to control the speed of fan systems properly. It uses sensing data of three important sensors via the intelligent decision-making procedures. An ATmega16A microcontroller adjusts the speed of a DC motor based on the calculated speed via pulse-width modulation (PWM). Furthermore, speed percentage will be shown on a LCD. Simulation results show that the proposed system reduces total current consumption and total energy consumption compared to another fan system. Firstly, AutoFanSys is designed in Proteus simulator and program file of the microcontroller is generated in CodeVison AVR. Secondly, it is implemented by electromechanical devices to would be applied in real applications (e.g., living room, plant factory, and computer case).</div>
